# 📘 Admin Dashboard Widgets Editor – Usage Guide

This guide explains how to use the Admin Dashboard Widgets Editor to build custom WordPress dashboard layouts for specific user roles such as **members**, **artists**, and **organizations**.

---

## 🧩 Editing Layouts per Role

**What you can do:**
- Customize the dashboard layout **per role**
- Reorder widgets with drag-and-drop
- Show or hide specific widgets
- Add or remove available widgets

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to **Dashboard → Customize Widgets**
2. Use the **role selector** at the top to pick a user group
3. Drag, hide, or add widgets as needed
4. Click **💾 Save Layout** to apply your changes

---

## ➕ Using the "Add Widget" Panel

**Purpose:**  
Add widgets from the registered widget library to your selected layout.

**Steps:**
1. Click the **“Add Widget”** button
2. Browse available widgets — each includes a name, description, and preview
3. Check the box next to the widget(s) you want to add
4. Click **Add to Layout** — they'll appear in the editor list

---

## 👁 Show/Hide Widget Toggle

**Purpose:**  
Temporarily hide a widget without deleting it from the layout.

**How to use:**
- Each widget card includes a 👁️ Show/Hide button
- Toggling it will immediately update its visibility
- Hidden widgets stay in the layout but are not shown to the user

---

## 🖼 Live Layout Preview

**Purpose:**  
Preview what the dashboard will look like to users in the selected role.

**Details:**
- Appears below the layout editor
- Only shows **visible** widgets
- Uses the same output as actual widgets — real data included
- Automatically updates as you change layout order or visibility

---

## 🔁 Resetting a Layout

**Purpose:**  
Clear all role-specific changes and revert to the default layout.

**Steps:**
1. Select a role
2. Click the **Reset Layout** button
3. Confirm — this deletes the layout for that role

💡 Default layout will be used unless a user-specific or role-specific layout exists.

---

## 📤 Exporting a Layout

**Purpose:**  
Backup or reuse a layout across sites or environments.

**Steps:**
1. Select a role
2. Click **Copy Export** to copy the JSON layout to your clipboard

Example export format:
```json
[
  { "id": "welcome_widget", "visible": true },
  { "id": "stats_widget", "visible": false }
]
```

---

## 📥 Importing a Layout

**Steps:**
1. Paste your layout JSON into the **Import Layout** box
2. Click **Import**
3. Layout will update immediately if JSON is valid

⚠️ Only JSON in the correct format will be accepted.

## 👤 Who Can Use This?

Only users with the **`manage_options`** capability (typically administrators) can:
- Customize layouts
- Import/export layouts
- Reset role configurations

---

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- Layouts are stored in `wp_options` per role (and `user_meta` if per-user layouts are enabled)
- Format: `[{ id: "widget_id", visible: true }]`
- Supports drag-and-drop reordering with [SortableJS]
- Custom widgets can be registered via:
```php
DashboardWidgetRegistry::register('id', 'Title', 'Icon', 'Description', $callback);
```

---

## 🧪 Tips for Testing

- Use multiple test users with different roles
- Try importing/exporting layouts between staging and production
- Preview each layout after changes
- Use browser DevTools to check for JS errors if things don't update
