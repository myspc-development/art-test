# Social Auto-Posting Setup

The Social Auto-Posting module automatically shares newly published content to supported social networks.

## Opening the Settings Tab

1. Navigate to **ArtPulse → Settings** in the WordPress admin menu.
2. Click the **Social Auto-Posting** tab.

From here you can enable networks, enter API credentials and choose which post types should trigger an automatic post.

## Required API Keys

- **Facebook** – Access Token and Page ID from your Facebook App.
- **Instagram** – Graph API access token.
- **Twitter/X** – Bearer token from the developer portal.
- **Pinterest** – Access token and Board ID or name.

Enable at least one network and provide the corresponding credentials. Missing tokens will skip posting for that network.

## Supported Networks

Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X and Pinterest are currently supported. Each can be toggled individually and works with Events, Artworks, Organizations, Artists, News posts and Portfolio items.
