# Codex Documentation Workflow

Audience: Dev, PM

## Overview
These instructions guide the development team when auditing and unifying the Creator & Growth Codex documentation. Follow this process before each milestone to keep the knowledge base usable and sprint-ready.

## Document Review & Merge Checklist
- Search the repository for all `codex_*.md` files within the `docs/` directory or other folders.
- Build an index noting which codex file covers which sprint or module.
- Merge or remove any overlapping sections across files. Example: combine duplicate details in `codex_growth_stack.md` and `embed-widgets.md`.
- Verify that REST routes, UI names and filter options match the current plugin implementation.
- Each document must specify its primary audience: developer, PM, partner or artist.
- Ensure filenames follow the pattern `codex_[module-name].md`.
- Add `[ðŸš§ Sprint Needed]` for sections that reference future work.
- Insert `<!-- REVIEW: unclear -->` comments where logic or requirements need clarification.

## Editing Guidelines
- Use tables to show feature comparisons, access roles and sprint breakdowns.
- Keep heading hierarchy consistent: `##` for primary sections, `###` for subsections and lists beneath.
- Wrap REST or API calls in backticks or fenced code blocks.
- Emoji may appear in lists or tables but never in headings.
- Include a `## Dev Checklist` section in every module document with tasks or acceptance criteria.
- Conclude with a "See also:" list of related codex files.

## Suggested Next Sprint Options
After cleanup, evaluate readiness of these groups:

| Sprint Block | Goal | Review Scope |
|--------------|------|--------------|
| **N1â€“N3** | Institution/Education Toolkit | Check RSVP tracking and class visit specs |
| **M5â€“M7** | Creator Reputation & Commissioning | Confirm access control and public vs private views |
| **K5â€“K6** | Mobile Crawl Night Add-ons | Verify check-ins and route saving integration |
| **O1â€“O2** | Metrics & Export Engine | Ensure event logs support analytics and CSV exports |

### Recommended Focus Choices
- **N1: Class Visit Tracking** â€“ Extends existing check-in logic for schools.
- **M5: Curator Call for Submissions** â€“ Builds upon curator tools for open curation.
- **K5: Crawl Mode MVP** â€“ Connects nearby map, QR flows and field logging.
- **O1: Reporting Snapshot Builder** â€“ Provides admins quick grant reporting.
