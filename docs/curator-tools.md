# Curator Tools Overview

This guide summarizes the dashboard utilities available to curators.

## 1. Creating Bundles
Curators can group several events into a themed bundle or "thread." Use the bundle builder on the dashboard to search events, add annotations and set a publish date. See [codex-phase-m-creator-curator-codex.md](codex-phase-m-creator-curator-codex.md) for the full workflow.

## 2. Tracking RSVPs
Each bundle displays aggregated RSVP counts for the included events. Curators may export attendee lists or message all RSVPs via the messaging API. Refer to [messaging-communication-codex.md](messaging-communication-codex.md) for the relevant endpoints.

## 3. Private Notes
Curators can attach private notes while reviewing shows. Notes are stored per event and only visible to users with the `ap_curator` role. For details on data fields see [curator-feedback.md](curator-feedback.md).

## 4. Roles and Permissions
Curator tools require the `ap_curator` capability. Administrators can assign this role via the Users screen. Curators may view artist profiles, edit their own bundles and manage notes, but they cannot publish events or manage site settings.
