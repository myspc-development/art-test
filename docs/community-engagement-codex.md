# ArtPulse Codex: Community Engagement

This guide summarizes optional modules that encourage interaction and discovery.

## 1. Forums

Organizations can enable a simple forum for discussions about their events or artist topics. Each forum lives under a custom post type and exposes REST endpoints for threads and replies. Permissions mirror comment capabilities.

## 2. Feedback & Upvotes

Members can submit feedback and suggestions on events, artworks or features. Others may upvote ideas to signal interest. Upvote totals display next to each suggestion and organizers can sort by popularity. Feedback posts can trigger notifications to the event owner.

## 3. Spotlights

Administrators may feature notable artists or events in a "Spotlight" section. The module pulls a curated list via the REST API and displays it with prominent styling. Spotlights can rotate weekly or be pinned to the dashboard.

## 4. Competitions

The plugin supports optional competitions or challenges. Organizers create a competition post and members submit entries or vote on favorites. Winners are highlighted in a results view and may receive badges or rewards.

## 5. Social Features

Follow buttons let users keep up with artists, events and organizations. Activity feeds show when followed creators publish new content. Sharing links appear on event and artwork pages so visitors can easily post them on external networks.
