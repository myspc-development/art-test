# ✅ Codex Verification & Status Update Checklist

## 🔍 Verification Tasks
- [ ] Search codebase for `[🚧 Sprint Needed]` and `- [ ]` to catch all pending tasks.
- [ ] Review all roadmap/backlog markdown files to confirm accurate status:
  - Mark finished tasks as ✅
  - Move “In Progress” to “Done” if appropriate
  - Add “In Progress” tag if work has started

- [ ] Update Codex Index:
  - Ensure each referenced doc exists in `docs/`
  - Remove references to missing files
  - Add new files to index

- [ ] Cross-check Feature Completion Tracker and Sprint Backlog for consistency.

## 🔁 Recommend running these checks weekly during sprint planning.
