# Admin Settings UI

This guide merges the "Admin Configuration UI" and [Settings Page Codex](../settings-page-codex.md) documents.
Administrators can manage dashboard widgets and plugin options from the Settings
pages. The interface uses tabbed navigation and integrates with the WordPress
menu system.

## Key Features
- Manage Widget Block availability per role
- Lock specific widgets for all users
- Organize settings into tabs such as General, Import/Export, Backup and Updates
- Examples provided for PHP hooks and React components
