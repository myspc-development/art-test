Use the **Role** dropdown to load layouts for a specific role. Widgets may be dragged within the grid preview. Press **Save** to store changes.

## Visibility Settings

Each widget has a visibility toggle. You can restrict widgets to certain roles or lock them so users cannot remove them.

## Audit Panel

The audit panel lists all registered widgets with search and sort controls for rapid troubleshooting.
