# Admin Feature Documentation Review

The table below summarizes documentation coverage for key admin-facing features. Suggestions highlight areas to expand or clarify.

| Feature Area | Exists? | Coverage Quality | Suggestions |
|--------------|---------|------------------|-------------|
| SettingsPage | ✅ | Moderate | Document advanced options and link to REST endpoints |
| Widget Editor UI (removed) | ❌ | N/A | Replaced by the Dashboard Builder |
| Roles UI | ✅ | Strong | See [Admin Dashboard UI](./admin-dashboard-ui.md) for per‑role layouts and fallback logic. Related code lives in [`DashboardController.php`](../../src/Core/DashboardController.php) and [`page-dashboard-config.php`](../../admin/page-dashboard-config.php) |

Use this checklist when updating docs to ensure all admin workflows are fully explained.
