# Admin Dashboard UI

This guide details how administrators configure dashboard layouts for each user role. It builds on the Dashboard Builder and covers saving behavior, widget management and REST updates.

ğŸ”— Available widgets and role visibility can now be managed in the [Dashboard Builder](../widgets/widget-matrix-reference.md).

## Role Based Configuration

Dashboard layouts are stored per role in the `artpulse_dashboard_layouts` option. Each entry is an array of widget IDs in display orderâ€”not block markup. The builder fetches the configuration for the selected role via `GET /wp-json/artpulse/v1/layout/{role}`. If no layout exists the default preset is used.

Admins choose a role from the **Role** dropdown before arranging widgets. Switching roles reloads the layout and available widgets for that role.

```js
// Example request
fetch('/wp-json/artpulse/v1/layout/artist')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(layout => renderLayout(layout));
```

### Artist Dashboard Example

An Artist layout might include widgets for managing artworks, sales reports and audience insights. Enable monetization blocks like **Artwork Manager** and **Payout Summary** so artists can track revenue.

### Organization Dashboard Example

Organizations typically arrange widgets such as **Ticketing Overview**, **Event Analytics** and **Staff Notices**. Use the role dropdown to load the `organization` layout and configure widgets for event management.

## Widgets and Layout Logic

Widgets appear in the **Add Widget** panel. Drag widgets into the main grid to add them. Layouts use a simple 12 column system and widgets define their default width. The editor prevents overlaps and snaps widgets into rows.

- **Lock Widget** toggles whether a widget can be removed by end users.
- **Reset Layout** reverts to the plugin default for the current role.
- **Save Layout** persists changes via a `POST` request.

## Saving and Resetting

Clicking **Save** sends the updated layout to `POST /wp-json/artpulse/v1/layout/{role}`. On success, a notice confirms the update. **Reset** deletes the stored layout so the next load falls back to defaults.

```js
await fetch('/wp-json/artpulse/v1/layout/member', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify(layout),
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
});
```

## Preview Mode & Styling

Dashboard Preview now loads the `[ap_user_dashboard]` shortcode in an iframe so administrators can switch roles and see the actual layout. Access the preview from **ArtPulse â†’ Dashboard**. A style panel lets you configure background color, border and padding presets. Saved values are stored under the `style` key in `ap_dashboard_widget_config`.

Use the **Preview asâ€¦** dropdown to impersonate a role. Changes to layout or style can be saved directly from the preview window.
