# ArtPulse User Guide

For site management details see the [Admin Guide](admin-guide.md). A quick
overview of features lives in the [README](../README.md).

## Event Cards

Event listings across the site use a consistent card design. Each card includes
the featured image, title, venue, address, and formatted dates. RSVP and
favorite buttons appear with their current counts so you can interact directly
from any directory, calendar popover or dashboard list.
