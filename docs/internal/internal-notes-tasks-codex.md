# ArtPulse Codex: Internal Notes & Task Tracking

This guide outlines an optional collaboration module for teams managing events. It introduces private internal notes and assignable tasks that appear on each event's admin view.

## 1. Internal Notes Widget

Display a **Notes** panel on every event detail screen. Team members can add and view private notes with timestamps.

- Provide a textarea and **Add Note** button.
- Each note lists the author, timestamp and content.
- Note authors and organization admins can edit or delete their notes.
- Store notes in a custom table keyed by event ID, org ID and user ID.

## 2. Event Task List

Add a **Tasks** section to the event admin page for actionable items.

- Tasks include a title, optional description, assignee, due date and status.
- Status options: **Open**, **In Progress**, **Done**.
- Only organization members can add or modify tasks for their events.
- Use a custom table to store task data with created and updated timestamps.

## 3. Task Assignment & Status

Allow tasks to be assigned to team members.

- The assignee dropdown only lists current org members.
- Log who updates a task and when the status changes.
- Optionally restrict marking a task as done to the assignee or org admins.

## 4. Task & Note Summaries

Surface key info in dashboards.

- Show the count of open tasks per event.
- Display the most recent note preview on event lists.
- Allow filtering events by overdue tasks or recent notes.

## 5. Notifications (Optional)

Implement basic notifications as needed.

- Notify a user when a task is assigned to them.
- Optionally send daily or weekly digests for overdue tasks.
- Trigger an alert when a new note is added if opted in.

## 6. Permissions, Security & Extensibility

- Gate all notes and tasks to members of the organization.
- Provide hooks to extend task fields (e.g., priority or attachments).
- Log all actions for accountability.

## 7. UI/UX & Accessibility Notes

- Ensure all forms and lists work with keyboard navigation.
- Use color coding or icons for task statuses.
- Confirm deletes with modals and show success/error messages after each action.

## 8. Maintenance

Admins may periodically clean up old completed tasks or notes and should document any schema changes for future integrations.
