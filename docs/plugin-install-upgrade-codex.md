# Plugin Install & Upgrade Best Practices

This codex documents safe patterns for creating or updating database tables during plugin activation and upgrades. It complements the existing codex files under `docs/`.

## Validate Array Keys

When building column or index definitions in PHP arrays, always verify that the required keys exist before using them:

```php
foreach ($indexes as $index) {
    if (
        !isset($index['index_type']) ||
        !isset($index['index_name']) ||
        !isset($index['index_columns'])
    ) {
        error_log('Invalid index definition: ' . print_r($index, true));
        continue; // Skip invalid definitions
    }
    // Safe to build SQL
}
```

## Defensive Table/Column Creation

Never assume a schema array contains all expected fields. Check each key with `isset()` or provide a sensible default.

```php
if (isset($column['column_name']) && isset($column['column_type'])) {
    // build column definition
}
```

## Logging Invalid Schema

If a table, column or index definition is incomplete, log the problem and skip that part of the definition. This prevents malformed SQL from reaching `dbDelta()` and makes debugging easier.

## Avoid Empty Names in SQL

Doubleâ€‘check that generated SQL statements never include empty table, column or index names. Statements such as `ADD `` ()` should never be produced.

## Activation Hooks

Activation hooks should abort gracefully if table creation fails. Use error logging to capture the failure, but avoid executing partially constructed SQL statements.

Following these practices helps prevent undefined index warnings and broken SQL during plugin installs or upgrades.
