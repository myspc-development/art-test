# Finalization Report

All documentation for Sprints 1â€“3 has been reviewed and finalized. Metadata inconsistencies were corrected, missing feedback footers were added and incomplete READMEs were expanded. New admin UX guides cover dashboard configuration and upcoming role preview features.

See the [Implementation Report](./implementation-report.md) and [Validation Report](./validation-report.md) for detailed status checks.
