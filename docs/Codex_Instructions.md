Codex Instructions for Reviewing & Implementing Next Steps
1. Codex Review Process
Each codex file (found in docs/) covers a specific functional area. Use this process to review and plan work:

âœ… Step 1: Open relevant codex files:

admin-analytics-codex.md

analytics-insights-codex.md

monetization-ticketing-codex.md

ui-ux-polish-codex.md

etc.

âœ… Step 2: For each codex, evaluate:

Does it clearly define REST endpoints, UI components, or data models?

Is there a checklist or sample payload? If not, add one.

Are permissions, validation, and nonce handling specified?

âœ… Step 3: Use the roadmap documents to mark items as:

ðŸ”² Not implemented

ðŸ”„ In progress

âœ… Complete

2. Suggested Implementation Order
Start with higher-priority, foundational features:

Auto-Tagger NLP (Docs: Future NLP Codex or update existing)

Add architecture notes for tagging

Include sample dataset or classification logic

Define multilingual support expectations

Ticketing & Membership (monetization-ticketing-codex.md)

Describe data structure: CPTs, metadata

Specify WooCommerce hooks (if used)

Add UI examples (e.g., ticket selector)

Analytics Dashboard (analytics-insights-codex.md)

List widget types (e.g., follower growth, ticket sales)

Define required data endpoints

Include mock UI wireframes or embed link

3. Update Codex Format Standards
Ensure consistency across codex files by including:

Endpoints Table:

Method	Route	Permission Callback	Description

UI Component Specs:

Component name

Props & structure

Data dependencies

Example JSON Payloads

Security Notes: Nonce, roles, capabilities

Internationalization Tips: Labels, translations

4. Development Tasks From Codex Review
As you complete codex reviews, translate missing specs into development tasks:

Use the Feature_Backlog.md to track them

Link codex section in task description

Create GitHub issues (or Jira tickets) for each task

Tag with priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
