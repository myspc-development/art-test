# ArtPulse Codex: Sprint 4 â€” Polish & Documentation

This sprint ensures that ArtPulse is usable, presentable and maintainable for pilot launches and partner onboarding.

## 1. UX/UI Polish

### Goal
Refine the UI across dashboards, widgets and embedded components for clarity, responsiveness and accessibility.

### Target Areas
| Component | Polish Task |
| --- | --- |
| Ticket Purchase Modal | Improve loading states and error handling |
| Live Event Chat | Auto-scroll behavior, mobile input UX |
| Q&A Threads | Highlight artist answers, fix collapsed threads |
| Analytics Dashboard | Add period comparison (e.g. "â†‘15% since last month") |
| Embeddable Widgets | Respect dark/light mode styles, add cache-busting version param |

### Frontend Enhancements
- Use `react-error-boundary` for user-generated content sections.
- Ensure all forms (donation, ticketing, org roles) show success/failure messages clearly.
- Mobile-first tweaks for:
  - Org Matrix
  - Event Detail Pages
  - Analytics graphs

### Accessibility & ARIA
- Add `aria-*` labels to interactive widgets.
- Ensure tab order is logical.
- Color contrast validated (AA level or better).

### QA Checklist
| Element | Test |
| --- | --- |
| Forms | Submitting shows loading + feedback |
| Charts | Work at 320px width |
| Live Chat | Scrolls reliably, not jumpy |
| All Views | Load <1s in staging |

## 2. Codex & Developer Documentation

### Goal
Package internal implementation and integration documentation for dev onboarding, plugin contributors and partner orgs.

### Recommended Structure (Markdown or Notion)
| Section | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| Overview | Stack, plugin structure, feature roadmap |
| Codex Sprints Aâ€“D | Discovery, Tools, Community, Monetization |
| Sprint E | Widgets, Calendar, Analytics, Ranking, API |
| API Docs | REST endpoints with example payloads |
| Data Models | `ap_event`, `ap_flags`, `ap_event_rankings`, etc. |
| Testing & QA | Manual test scripts + automated coverage |
| Deployment | Build steps, cron jobs, API key mgmt |

### Packaging Instructions
- Generate `.md` versions from Codex for GitHub `/docs/`.
- Create `swagger.json` or `openapi.yaml` for public/partner API. A generated `openapi.yaml` is available under `/docs`.
- Include architecture diagrams:
  - REST structure
  - Table relationships
  - Auth flow (e.g., partner API bearer token handshake)

### Export Targets
| Format | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Internal Dev Docs | Notion or GitHub Wiki |
| Plugin Docs | `/docs/*.md` in GitHub |
| Partner Docs | Google Docs / PDF export |
| API Docs | SwaggerHub or Redocly embed |

### QA Checklist
| Artifact | Test |
| --- | --- |
| API Doc | Copy/paste code samples work |
| Data Schema | Matches actual DB columns |
| Architecture Diagram | Clear enough to onboard new dev |
| Cron Job Reference | All job hooks listed and explained |

### Developer Sprint Checklist
| Task | Status |
| --- | --- |
| React UI polished for chat, ticketing, Q&A | âœ… |
| Mobile responsiveness tested site-wide | âœ… |
| Accessibility reviewed and ARIA added | âœ… |
| Codex split into Markdown chapters | âœ… |
| Partner API doc (Swagger/OpenAPI) generated | âœ… |

### Bonus Suggestions
- Add `/status` endpoint: shows build version, DB migrations.
- Add changelog generator: `git log --oneline --grep="^feat\|fix"`.

### Codex Docs To Update
- Sprint 1â€“3 integration status.
- Admin UX Guide â€“ screenshots of improved widgets.
- Partner Onboarding Guide â€“ step-by-step API use.
