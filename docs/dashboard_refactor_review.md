# Dashboard Refactor Review

This checklist summarizes the code and documentation alignment work.

- Created `LayoutUtils` under `includes/Core` for layout normalization and style merging.
- Updated `UserLayoutManager` and `DashboardWidgetTools` to use the new helper.
- REST docs now reference `POST` requests for `/layout/{role}`.
- Widget editor sources documented at `assets/js/widget-editor/WidgetEditorApp.jsx`.
- Added unit tests for style output and role filtering.

Use this file as a reference when extending the dashboard system.
