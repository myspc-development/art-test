# ðŸš¨ Diagnostic Prompt: Prevent Duplicate REST Route Definitions

Use this guide to add an automated check to your development workflow to detect and report duplicate REST API route registrations during plugin development.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Duplicate `register_rest_route()` calls can lead to:

- Endpoint collisions
- Conflicting handlers
- Hard-to-debug API errors
- Performance degradation

---

## ðŸ§° Implementation Options

### Option 1: Hook-Based Warning System (Development Only)

Add the following to a file loaded during development (e.g., `includes/dev/debug-rest.php`):

```php
add_filter('rest_endpoints', function ($endpoints) {
    $seen = [];
    foreach ($endpoints as $route => $handlers) {
        if (isset($seen[$route])) {
            error_log("[REST DUPLICATE] Route already registered: $route");
        }
        $seen[$route] = true;
    }
    return $endpoints;
});
```

### Option 2: CLI Inspection Script (Recommended)

Run the bundled checker to scan all registered routes after WordPress boots:

```bash
php tools/rest-route-conflicts.php
```

- Use `--json` for machine-readable output.
- Pass `--suggest-fix` to print code snippets that guard new registrations with an existing route check.

The script exits with a non-zero status when conflicts are detected. It is invoked automatically from the project's pre-commit hook so new duplicates are caught before code is committed.
