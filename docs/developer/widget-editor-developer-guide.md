# Widget Editor Developer Guide

> **Deprecated:** The Widget Editor has been removed in favor of the
> Dashboard Builder. This document remains for historical reference only.

Combines implementation notes from the Dashboard Editor guide and Codex
instructions. Covers adding new widgets, REST endpoints and verification
checklists.

### Role Examples

The editor supports unique layouts for every role. For artists you might register widgets like `artwork_manager` and `payout_summary` so creators can monetize their work. Organizations often include `ticketing_overview` and `analytics_report` widgets for event tracking.

Preview mode loads the full dashboard in an iframe. Admins can toggle roles and adjust base widget styles. POST requests to `/layout/{role}` now accept a `style` object along with the layout array. React sources previously lived in `assets/js/widget-editor/WidgetEditorApp.jsx` and were bundled to `build/widget-editor-ui.js` before the feature was removed.
