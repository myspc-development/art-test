# Codex: Sprint J4 – Project Budget & Impact Templates

## Overview
This sprint introduces reusable templates for calculating project budgets and reporting community impact. The tools let organizations outline costs, expected revenue and post-event success metrics.

## Goals
- Provide budget worksheets for event planners
- Offer impact report templates for grant-ready summaries
- Export results as PDF or CSV
- Encourage consistent data entry across teams

## Budget Template Example
| Item | Estimated Cost | Actual Cost |
| ---- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Venue rental | $1,500 | $1,400 |
| Marketing | $800 | $950 |
| Supplies | $300 | $250 |
| **Total** | **$2,600** | **$2,600** |

Admins can copy this table when creating a new event or project. Totals update automatically if formulas are enabled in the editor.

## Impact Template Example
| Metric | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| Attendees | 325 |
| New followers | 60 |
| Donations raised | $4,300 |
| Press mentions | 3 |

Use this template after each event to summarize reach and engagement. Reports can be combined across multiple events for grant applications.
