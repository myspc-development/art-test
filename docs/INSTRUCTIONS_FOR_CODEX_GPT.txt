# ArtPulse Plugin Sprint Bundle
This package contains a set of 10 sprint documents for enhancing and maintaining the ArtPulse Management Plugin.

## Instructions for Codex GPT Implementation

1. Read each sprint document (Sprint_1 to Sprint_10) sequentially.
2. For each sprint:
   - Identify and implement tasks as code modules or patches.
   - Use comments to explain architecture or decisions.
   - Test changes according to described deliverables.
3. Maintain modular, documented code with performance and security in mind.
4. Where external services are mentioned (e.g., Stripe, Chart.js), mock or stub for testing.
5. After each sprint, verify output against deliverables listed in the document.
6. Prioritize maintainability, extensibility, and WordPress standards throughout.

Good luck. Begin with Sprint_1_Environment_Setup.txt.
