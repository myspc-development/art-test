# Codex: Phase M – Creator & Curator Module

## Overview
This phase unifies tools for artists, curators and collectives so ArtPulse becomes a creator-driven ecosystem rather than only a listings portal. The module spans four sprints and introduces collaboration features, curated threads, curator profiles and dashboard utilities.

## Module Goals
| Role | Capabilities Introduced |
| --- | --- |
| Artists | Claim, co-list, and showcase shows they’re part of |
| Collectives | Form public pages and project hubs |
| Curators | Create thematic threads, track RSVPs, publish annotated bundles |
| Admins | Unlock dashboard tools to view collaboration notes and network reach |

## Features by Sprint
