# Recommended For You Widget

Suggests events or artists based on prior activity or interests. Users can fineâ€‘tune results via the `preferred_tags`, `ignored_tags` and `blacklist_ids` fields saved through the `/artpulse/v1/user-preferences` endpoint. The widget falls back to trending content when no history is available.
