# Admin Widget Editor Guide

> **Note:** The legacy Widget Editor was removed in version 2.0. Use the
> [Dashboard Builder](../widgets/widget-matrix-reference.md) to configure
> role-based dashboards. This page remains for historical reference only.

This document combines the original Admin Dashboard Widgets Editor guide with
usage instructions. It describes how administrators can customize dashboard
layouts for different user roles.

- Launch the builder under **ArtPulse â†’ Dashboard Builder**
- Drag and drop widgets to build role-specific dashboards
- Save or reset layouts for each role
- Filter the **Add Widget** panel by category or role
- Each card displays which roles can view the widget
- ğŸ”— View available widgets and role visibility in the [Widget Matrix](../widgets/widget-matrix-reference.md)
