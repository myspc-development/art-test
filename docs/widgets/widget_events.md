# Upcoming Events (Member)

**Widget ID:** `widget_events`

**Roles:** member, organization

## Description
Events happening soon.

The widget queries upcoming events with `GET /wp-json/artpulse/v1/events/upcoming` and shows the next five by default. Administrators can modify the limit by adjusting the `events_per_page` attribute when registering the block.

### Customization
- Use the **Widget Visibility** screen to enable or disable this widget per role.
- Drag the tile in the Dashboard Builder to position it alongside other widgets.
