# ArtPulse Admin Guide

See the [User Guide](user-guide.md) for instructions that attendees follow when interacting with events and the calendar.

## RSVP Management

- Open the event in your dashboard and click **View RSVPs**.
- Mark each attendee as **Attended** or leave unchecked.
- Use **Export RSVPs to CSV** to download a spreadsheet of all responses.

## Attendee Messaging

- Click **Message All** to email every RSVP'd user.
- Use the message icon next to any attendee to send a single message.
- Emails use your configured notification settings.

## Event Analytics

- Dashboards visualize total RSVPs, favorites and attendance.
- Charts show trends over time and top events at a glance.
- Data can be exported as CSV for further analysis.

## Embedding the Event Calendar

Use the `[ap_event_calendar]` shortcode to place the calendar anywhere on the site. Shortcode attributes let you filter by venue, category, and date or change display options.

## Accessibility & Mobile Notes

All admin tools are responsive and keyboard accessible so you can manage events from any device.
