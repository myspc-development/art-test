## Managing RSVPs & Attendees

### Viewing and Exporting RSVPs

- In your dashboard, go to the event you are managing.
- Click "View RSVPs" to see all attendee details (name, email, RSVP date, attendance status).
- Click "Export RSVPs to CSV" to download a spreadsheet of attendees.

### Marking Attendance

- Check/uncheck the "Attended" box next to each attendee.
- Attendance stats update in real time and appear in event analytics.

### Messaging Attendees

- Use the "Message All" button to email all RSVPâ€™d users at once.
- Use the mail/message icon next to any attendee to send a message to a single user.
- Messages use your default notification settings.

### Waitlist (If Enabled)

- If an event is full, new RSVPs are added to a waitlist.
- When a slot opens, waitlisted users are notified automatically.

## Engagement Analytics

- Analytics dashboards appear for both users and organizers.
- Widgets show:
  - **Total RSVPs** (overall and per event)
  - **Favorites** (total and per event)
  - **Attendance** (marked "attended" for each event)
  - **Current waitlist count**
  - **Trends over time** (line/bar charts powered by Chart.js)

### How to Read Analytics

- Hover over any point on a chart to see exact counts.
- View "top events" by RSVP/favorite count in the analytics list.
- Export data as CSV for your own reporting.

## Event Calendar Embeds

Use the shortcode `ap_event_calendar` to add a calendar anywhere on the site. Calendar options can be customized via shortcode attributes to control filters and display.

## Accessibility & Mobile Notes

All admin tools are built with responsive layouts. Forms, buttons and lists can be managed via keyboard navigation and screen readers.
