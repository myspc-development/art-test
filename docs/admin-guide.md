# ArtPulse Admin Guide

See the [User Guide](user-guide.md) for instructions that attendees follow when interacting with events and the calendar. For a feature overview refer to the [README](../README.md).

## RSVP Management

- Open the event in your dashboard and click **View RSVPs**.
- Mark each attendee as **Attended** or leave unchecked.
- Use **Export RSVPs to CSV** to download a spreadsheet of all responses.

## Attendee Messaging

- Click **Message All** to email every RSVP'd user.
- Use the message icon next to any attendee to send a single message.
- Emails use your configured notification settings.

## Event Analytics

- Dashboards visualize total RSVPs, favorites and attendance.
- Charts show trends over time and top events at a glance.
- Data can be exported as CSV for further analysis.

## Embedding the Event Calendar

Use the `[ap_event_calendar]` shortcode to place the calendar anywhere on the site. Shortcode attributes let you filter by venue, category, and date or change display options.

## Settings Tab Layout

All plugin options live under **ArtPulse â†’ Settings** in the admin menu. The
page is divided into tabs. Click **General**, **Location APIs**, **Import/Export**
or **Shortcode Pages** to reveal the fields for each area. The active tab is
tracked via the URL hash so you can share a direct link like `#/import_export`.

## Accessibility & Mobile Notes

All admin tools are responsive and keyboard accessible so you can manage events from any device.
