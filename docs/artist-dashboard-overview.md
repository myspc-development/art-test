# Artist Dashboard Overview

The `[ap_artist_dashboard]` shortcode renders a personalized workspace for artists. From this page you can load presets and rearrange widgets using the builtâ€‘in Dashboard Builder UI.

## Accessing the Dashboard

1. Log in to your account.
2. Visit the page that contains the shortcode, typically **/artist-dashboard**.
3. Click **Edit Layout** to launch the builder.

## Choosing a Layout Preset

Use the **Preset** dropdown to load a predefined layout. Switching presets reloads the widget arrangement without saving changes.

## Rearranging Widgets

Drag widgets to new locations or resize them within the grid. The **Add Widget** panel lets you insert additional components. When finished, click **Save** to store your layout. **Reset Layout** reverts to the default artist preset.

For administrator settings and advanced options see [Admin Dashboard UI](admin/admin-dashboard-ui.md).
