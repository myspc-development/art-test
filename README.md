# ArtPulse Management Plugin

## CSV Import/Export

An Import/Export tab is available under **ArtPulse → Settings**. From this tab administrators can:

- Upload a CSV file and map its columns to post fields or meta keys. After selecting the mappings a preview of the first few rows is displayed before importing.
- Import data in chunks via the REST API endpoint `artpulse/v1/import`.
- Download CSV exports for organizations, events, artists and artworks.

Only users with the `manage_options` capability may perform imports. PapaParse is used client side for parsing CSV files.
## Membership Overrides

The **ArtPulse → Settings** page includes options allowing administrators to bypass membership checks and fees for specific user types. Enabling these checkboxes disables enforcement for the corresponding role:

- **Override Artist Membership** – Artists can access paid features without an active membership.
- **Override Organization Membership** – Organizations are exempt from membership requirements and fees.
- **Override Member Membership** – Regular members are exempt from membership checks.
