# ArtPulse Management Plugin

## CSV Import/Export

An Import/Export tab is available under **ArtPulse → Settings**. From this tab administrators can:

- Upload a CSV file and map its columns to post fields or meta keys. After selecting the mappings a preview of the first few rows is displayed before importing.
- Import data in chunks via the REST API endpoint `artpulse/v1/import`.
- Download CSV exports for organizations, events, artists and artworks.

During import you can configure:

* Whether the uploaded file contains a header row.
* Which delimiter to use (comma, semicolon, tab or a custom character).
* How many initial rows should be skipped before parsing.

Only users with the `manage_options` capability may perform imports. PapaParse is used client side for parsing CSV files.
## Membership Overrides

The **ArtPulse → Settings** page includes options allowing administrators to bypass membership checks and fees for specific user types. Enabling these checkboxes disables enforcement for the corresponding role:

- **Override Artist Membership** – Artists can access paid features without an active membership.
- **Override Organization Membership** – Organizations are exempt from membership requirements and fees.
- **Override Member Membership** – Regular members are exempt from membership checks.

## Event Auto-Expiration

When **Auto-expire Past Events** is enabled under **ArtPulse → Settings**, a daily cron job runs and moves any `artpulse_event` posts whose end date is before today to Draft status. This keeps old events from appearing on the site automatically.

## Directory Shortcodes

Use the new directory shortcodes to display listings without specifying a type attribute:

- `[ap_event_directory]`
- `[ap_artist_directory]`
- `[ap_artwork_directory]`
- `[ap_org_directory]`

The older `[ap_directory]` shortcode is still supported for backward compatibility.

## Login Shortcode

Use `[ap_login]` to display the front-end login form.

## Registration Shortcode

Use `[ap_register]` to display a standalone registration form for new users. Signing up through this form automatically grants the “Free” membership level.
